# Loading GameCube Games & Other GC Content

> [!NOTE]
> Last updated: December 9, 2025

Loading GameCube games (or other homebrew) is a terminal process. Since there's no GUI, this is the only way to load ROMs into the system. To do so; you use the `--iso` flag:

```sh
./freecube --iso="~/backups/gc/example.iso
```

Non-ISO formats are not supported, and loading raw DOL files is also not supported.
